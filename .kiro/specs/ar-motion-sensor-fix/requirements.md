# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AR functionality in the Duck Hunt application is not responding to device orientation changes. Users expect the AR camera view to move and rotate as they turn their phone around, but currently the screen remains static. This breaks the core AR experience where users should be able to look around their environment to find virtual ducks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the AR camera view to respond to my device orientation changes, so that I can look around my environment naturally to find ducks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user tilts their device left or right THEN the AR camera view SHALL rotate accordingly
2. WHEN the user turns their device up or down THEN the AR camera view SHALL tilt accordingly  
3. WHEN the user rotates their device around (compass direction) THEN the AR camera view SHALL pan accordingly
4. WHEN the user moves their device THEN the camera orientation SHALL update smoothly without jitter
5. IF motion sensor permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL provide fallback controls for camera movement

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the AR scene to use my device camera as the background, so that I can see virtual ducks overlaid on my real environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AR mode is activated THEN the system SHALL request camera permissions
2. WHEN camera permissions are granted THEN the camera feed SHALL be displayed as the scene background
3. WHEN the camera is active THEN virtual ducks SHALL appear overlaid on the real environment
4. IF camera permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message
5. WHEN AR mode is stopped THEN the camera feed SHALL be properly released

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want motion sensor permissions to be properly requested and handled, so that the AR experience works on iOS devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts on iOS 13+ THEN the system SHALL request DeviceOrientationEvent permissions
2. WHEN the app starts on iOS 13+ THEN the system SHALL request DeviceMotionEvent permissions  
3. WHEN permissions are granted THEN motion sensors SHALL be activated for AR tracking
4. WHEN permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL show a clear explanation and retry option
5. WHEN motion sensors are active THEN device orientation changes SHALL be detected and processed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the AR camera controls to work smoothly across different devices and browsers, so that I have a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the app on iOS Safari THEN camera orientation SHALL respond to device movement
2. WHEN using the app on Android Chrome THEN camera orientation SHALL respond to device movement
3. WHEN the device orientation changes rapidly THEN the camera movement SHALL be smooth and not jerky
4. WHEN there are sensor reading errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
5. WHEN switching between portrait and landscape THEN the camera orientation SHALL adjust appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper AR.js integration for WebXR support, so that the AR experience uses standard web AR capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AR mode is activated THEN the system SHALL use AR.js for WebXR AR functionality
2. WHEN WebXR is supported THEN the system SHALL use native WebXR AR features
3. WHEN WebXR is not supported THEN the system SHALL fall back to camera-based AR simulation
4. WHEN AR tracking is active THEN virtual objects SHALL be properly positioned in 3D space
5. WHEN the user moves their device THEN virtual objects SHALL maintain their world positions
