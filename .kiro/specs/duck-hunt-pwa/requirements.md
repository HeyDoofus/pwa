# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Duck Hunt PWA is a mobile-responsive progressive web app that uses augmented reality (AR) to gamify the discovery of yellow toy ducks in real-world environments. Users hunt for virtual toy ducks through their mobile phone camera, using AR technology combined with motion sensors to create an immersive hunting experience. The app rewards users for successful duck collection and provides an engaging AR-based gaming experience that blends the digital and physical worlds.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to access the duck hunting game through a progressive web app, so that I can play without downloading a native app and have offline capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the app URL THEN the system SHALL load as a progressive web app with service worker support
2. WHEN a user is offline THEN the system SHALL provide cached functionality for core features
3. WHEN a user accesses the app on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface optimized for touch interaction
4. WHEN a user adds the app to their home screen THEN the system SHALL function as a standalone application

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to use my phone's camera to see yellow toy ducks in augmented reality, so that I can hunt for them in my real environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the camera mode THEN the system SHALL activate the device camera and display the live camera feed
2. WHEN toy ducks are nearby THEN the system SHALL overlay 3D yellow duck models in the AR view
3. WHEN a user moves their phone THEN the system SHALL use motion sensors to update the AR duck positions in real-time
4. WHEN environmental lighting changes THEN the system SHALL adjust duck rendering to match the real-world lighting conditions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to collect toy ducks by aiming and tapping on them in AR view, so that I can earn rewards and progress in the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user points their camera at a toy duck in AR THEN the system SHALL highlight the duck as targetable
2. WHEN a user taps on a highlighted toy duck THEN the system SHALL trigger a collection animation and remove the duck from AR view
3. WHEN a toy duck is collected THEN the system SHALL award points or rewards to the user
4. WHEN a user collects a duck THEN the system SHALL provide haptic feedback, visual effects, and sound confirmation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see my collection and rewards, so that I can track my progress and achievements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their profile THEN the system SHALL display total ducks collected and current score
2. WHEN a user views their collection THEN the system SHALL show all collected ducks with timestamps
3. WHEN a user earns rewards THEN the system SHALL display available rewards and redemption options
4. WHEN a user reaches milestones THEN the system SHALL unlock achievements and badges

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the app to work smoothly on my mobile device with AR and motion tracking, so that I can hunt for ducks while moving around.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user moves their device THEN the system SHALL use motion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope) to track device orientation accurately
2. WHEN the screen orientation changes THEN the system SHALL maintain AR tracking and adapt the interface accordingly
3. WHEN a user uses the app in various lighting conditions THEN the system SHALL maintain AR duck visibility and camera performance
4. WHEN a user has limited battery THEN the system SHALL optimize camera usage and sensor polling to preserve battery life

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want to grant camera and motion sensor permissions, so that the AR duck hunting experience can function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first opens the app THEN the system SHALL request camera access permissions with clear explanation
2. WHEN a user grants camera permissions THEN the system SHALL enable AR functionality and camera feed
3. WHEN a user grants motion sensor permissions THEN the system SHALL enable device orientation tracking for AR
4. WHEN permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL provide fallback functionality and explain the limitations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want to receive notifications about nearby ducks, so that I don't miss hunting opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new ducks appear near the user's location THEN the system SHALL send push notifications (if enabled)
2. WHEN a user grants notification permissions THEN the system SHALL respect their notification preferences
3. WHEN a user is inactive for extended periods THEN the system SHALL send engagement notifications about new duck spawns
4. WHEN special events occur THEN the system SHALL notify users about limited-time duck appearances
